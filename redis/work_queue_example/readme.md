# Work Queue Project (polling, notifications, logging, concurrency, redis)

This sample was taken from a machine learning blog:

Feel free to read the blog and understand the intent of the provided code.

## 1. Python Environment

- Recommended to use Python 3.11.3 (Download it here: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.3/)
- VSCode is recommended. You can launch VSCode from this directory. Then use the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → `"Python: Create Environment"`. Choose Python 3.11.3 and check the box for including `requirements.txt`.

If you didn't check the box to include `requirements.txt`, you can install the dependencies like this:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or like this:  

```
pip install tensorflow
pip install flask
pip install pillow
pip install redis
pip install requests
```

## 2. Setup settings.py

You will need to put your own redis connection information in [settings.py](settings.py). 
- Option 1: You can get a free 30mb REDIS account on redis.io
- Option 2: you could install REDIS locally

If you haven't already, you can set up REDIS following these instructions:  
https://github.com/byu-cs-452/byu-cs-452-class-content/blob/main/redis/01%20-%20Create%20Redis%20Cluster.md

The tutorial talks about apache web server but you can just run the commands in three separate shells (or threads in colab):

First shell:
```
python run_web_server.py 
```

Second shell:
```
python run_model_server.py
```

Third shell:
```
python simple_request.py 
```

# Deliverables (PDF that includes code)

1. What is the "key" in the REDIS database where the web server stores the user's image. What type is the value? Describe the structure of it.

2. How does the web server communicate with the model (worker) server to hand off work and receive back results? Describe how it works for the web server to respond to web requests.

3. What is the result of sending "[castle_image.jpg](castle_image.jpg)" through simple request?
What objects with which scores does it identify this as?

4. Does the current system have any issues if you were to have multiple font end servers (run_web_server.py) and multiple workes (run_model_server.py)? What issues are there? Update the code to fix one of these issues, test that it works, and explain with words and diagrams what you did to solve it.

5. Polling is the most expensive way to interact with a system. Polling can be reliable, but costly. Rather than having the web server poll REDIS waiting for a key to show up, could you research, think, and implement a way that instead uses notifications and only uses polling as a backup. Test your implementation and describe how you fixed it with words, code, and diagrams.

To use Redis notifications it is not that difficult. Though you do need to open the redis CLI (you can access from the cloud redis insight tool) and enable notifications:
```
CONFIG SET notify-keyspace-events KEA
```

The Code then to enable this would be:
```py
db = redis.StrictRedis(host=settings.REDIS_HOST,
	port=settings.REDIS_PORT, password=settings.REDIS_PASSWORD, db=settings.REDIS_DB)
# Define a handle to the pubsub
p = db.pubsub()

#....

# generate an ID for the classification then add the
# classification ID + image to the queue
k = str(uuid.uuid4())
image = helpers.base64_encode_image(image)
d = {"id": k, "image": image}

# Subscribe to key-space events for our specific key (subscribe before queueing work so we don't miss it!)
p.psubscribe(f"__keyspace@0__:{k}")

# Push work into queue
db.rpush(settings.IMAGE_QUEUE, json.dumps(d))

#....

print(f"waiting for message...")
result = p.get_message(timeout=24.0)
print (result)
output = db.get(k)
print (output)

```

6. The [stress_test.py](stress_test.py) code doesn't work. Could you fix it? (the threads are defined started and lost, they need to be "joined" so the program doesn't terminate before they are done)

7. Tracing what happens in a multi-agent system can be challenging. Can you write a simple logging function that can be called from any of the files that logs in a consistent format (server name, main running python script, timestamp, action)
